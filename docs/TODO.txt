# 1. Validators
#   Create some validators when API receives the request.
#   I'm thinking about (ajv / joi / express-validator)

# 2. Logs
#   Need to implement some feature to Log my application
#   like (winston / bunyan / LogLevel)

# 3. Tests
#   Need to implement tests on my application
#   Im thinking about jest or something like that

# 4. Best practices to implement try/catches
#   Here I just make it work, but I need to use this feature better
